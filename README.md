### What Is GroupThink

Per Wikipedia: 

[Groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs.[1] This causes the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation.[2][3]

Groupthink is a construct of social psychology, but has an extensive reach and influences literature in the fields of communication studies, political science, management, and organizational theory,[4] as well as important aspects of deviant religious cult behaviour.

### How Is Karma Addictive

We are all social creatures with a desire to create social capital, belong within a group, and contribute to said group.

The body's response to a sense of belonging and affirmation heavily rewards people with very similar feedback as it does with drug consumption. 

My hot take is that receiving feedback that your contribution was valuable, helpful, or agreed with gives you a rush of endorphins nearly as addictive as some chemical substances like meth, cocaine, and alcohol. I'm not making an argument that these responses to social behavior are as damaging as those other chemical addictions. They aren't, they are the basis for the social tendencies of humanity. However, they are also a weakness to be exploited for profit.

As a human you have an inherent addiction to the chemical response of social validation at some varying level. Regardless if it works on you, karma is a tool to deliver and exploit that validation and encourage you to spend more time on the Reddit platform interacting with others within your chosen social circles.
